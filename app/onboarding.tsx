You are creating an adaptive personality test that determines which of these 10 personality types a person aligns with:
${personalityTypes.join(', ')}

ALL 10 personality types must have an equal chance of being the final result. Design questions and options that can lead to ANY of these types based on authentic responses.

Create a deep, thought-provoking question that explores fundamental aspects of personality. The question should:
- Be open-ended enough to reveal authentic personality traits
- Use psychological principles to encourage honest responses
- Be engaging and make the person reflect genuinely
- Not be generic or predictable
- Focus on behaviors, motivations, or natural tendencies

Provide exactly 5 answer options that each represent different personality dimensions and could potentially lead to different personality types (including The Maverick, The Harmonizer, The Catalyst, etc.). Make the options nuanced and realistic - avoid obvious "good" or "bad" choices.

Format your response EXACTLY as:
QUESTION: [your question]
OPTION1: [first option]
OPTION2: [second option]
OPTION3: [third option]
OPTION4: [fourth option]
OPTION5: [fifth option]`;

Personality types being assessed (ALL have equal chance):
${personalityTypes.join(', ')}

Previous responses from the user:
${previousQA}

Previous questions asked (DO NOT REPEAT OR CREATE SIMILAR QUESTIONS):
- ${previousQuestions}

Topics/themes already covered (MUST AVOID): ${previousTopics}
Primary focuses used: ${usedPrimaryFocuses}

Based on their previous answers, generate a COMPLETELY NEW and UNIQUE question that:
- Builds on insights from their previous responses
- Digs deeper into emerging personality patterns
- Uses psychological techniques to reveal authentic traits
- Is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from all previous questions (no repetition of topics, themes, wording, or phrasing)
- Explores a NEW dimension of personality not yet covered
- Could lead to ANY of the 10 personality types, including less common ones like The Maverick, The Harmonizer, The Catalyst
- Makes them think deeply about their natural tendencies

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR UNIQUENESS:
1. DO NOT ask about any topics already covered: ${previousTopics}
2. DO NOT use similar phrasing or structure to previous questions
3. DO NOT ask variations of questions already asked
4. Choose a COMPLETELY NEW angle or scenario that hasn't been explored yet
5. Ensure answer options can lead to diverse personality types, not just The Explorer or The Thinker
6. Include options that might appeal to unconventional, independent, or harmony-seeking individuals
7. If question ${currentQuestion + 1} is in the later half of the test, dig into nuanced psychological aspects not typically covered in personality tests

UNEXPLORED TOPICS TO CONSIDER:
- Reaction to failure or setbacks
- Communication style preferences
- Relationship with time and planning
- Response to authority or tradition
- Approach to self-improvement
- Handling of emotions vs logic
- Preference for stability vs change
- Attitude toward competition
- Connection to nature or environment
- Response to criticism
- Role in community or society
- Relationship with material possessions
- Approach to spirituality or meaning
- Handling of success
- Preference for depth vs breadth in relationships

Provide exactly 5 answer options that are nuanced, realistic, and help distinguish between ALL personality types (especially ensure The Maverick, The Harmonizer, The Catalyst have viable options).

      const prompt = `You are a psychological personality assessment expert. Analyze the following responses from a personality test and determine which personality type best fits this person.

Available personality types:
1. The Explorer - Adventurous, curious, thrives on new experiences and discovery
2. The Connector - Empathetic, builds relationships, brings people together
3. The Creator - Imaginative, artistic, expresses through creativity
4. The Thinker - Analytical, intellectual, seeks deep understanding
5. The Adventurer - Bold, physical, pushes limits and embraces challenges
6. The Nurturer - Caring, supportive, creates safe spaces for growth
7. The Visionary - Strategic, innovative, sees future possibilities
8. The Catalyst - Transformative, challenges status quo, drives change
9. The Harmonizer - Balanced, diplomatic, creates peace and understanding
10. The Maverick - Independent, unconventional, forges unique paths

Test responses:
${answersText}

Based on their responses, determine their PRIMARY personality type. Consider:
- Patterns across all answers
- Core motivations and values
- Natural behavioral tendencies
- What energizes and fulfills them

IMPORTANT: All 10 types are EQUALLY valid and likely. There is NO bias toward any particular type. Analyze the responses holistically and objectively:
- Look for patterns of independence → The Maverick
- Look for patterns of balance and peace-seeking → The Harmonizer  
- Look for patterns of transformation and challenging norms → The Catalyst
- Look for patterns of caring and support → The Nurturer
- Look for patterns of strategic thinking → The Visionary
- Look for patterns of physical challenges → The Adventurer
- And so on for all types

Do NOT default to common types like "The Explorer" or "The Thinker" unless the evidence clearly points there. Give equal consideration to ALL 10 types.

Respond with ONLY the personality type name exactly as written above (e.g., "The Explorer" or "The Maverick" or "The Harmonizer"). Nothing else.`;
